The ONA can be configured to detect malware that alters files on network
shares, such as the CryptoLocker ransomware and variants.

The install_UbuntuTrusty.sh script in this directory will:
* Install and configure Samba to share a directory on the network
* Configure iptables to allow SMB through the firewall
* Configure RSYSLOG to log access to the network share
* Configure the ONA service to start the share watcher

The script is designed to work with the stock Ubuntu 14.04 image provided by
Observable Networks and likely won't work as expected on other systems.
